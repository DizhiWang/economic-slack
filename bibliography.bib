This article reviews a recent literature in public economics that combines the advantages of reduced-form strategies---transparent and credible identification---with an important advantage of structural models---the ability to make predictions about counterfactual outcomes and welfare. This literature has developed formulas for the welfare consequences of various policies that are functions of reduced-form elasticities rather than structural primitives. I present a general framework that shows how many policy questions can be answered by estimating a small set of sufficient statistics using program-evaluation methods. I use this framework to synthesize the modern literature on taxation, social insurance, and behavioral welfare economics. Finally, I discuss problems in macroeconomics, labor, development, and industrial organization that could be tackled using the sufficient statistic approach.},

Interpreting this as evidence of frictions in product markets, which require firms to spend resources on customer acquisition, this paper develops a search theoretic model of firm dynamics in frictional product markets. Introducing search frictions generates long-term customer relationships, rendering the customer base a state variable for firms, which is sluggish to adjust. This affects: the level and volatility of firm investment, sales, profits, value and markups, the timing of firm responses to shocks, and the relationship between investment and Tobin's q.

This chapter examines the size of fiscal multipliers in the midst of an economic recession, first estimating multipliers for a large number of Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries. Second, it adapts the authors' previous methodology to use direct projections rather than the standard structural vector autoregression (SVAR) approach to estimate multipliers, to economize on degrees of freedom, and to relax the assumptions on impulse response functions imposed by the SVAR method. Third, the chapter estimates responses not only of output but also of other macroeconomic aggregates. It is shown that multipliers of government purchases are larger in a recession, and that controlling for real-time predictions of government purchases tends to increase the estimated multipliers of government spending in recession.},
