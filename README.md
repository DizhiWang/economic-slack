# Slack in Macroeconomics

This repository contains material for ECON2800, a one-semester graduate course on slack in macroeconomics taught by [Pascal Michaillat](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/) at [Brown University](https://www.brown.edu).

## Overview

The course covers research topics related to slack in macroeconomics. It discusses both slack on the labor market (unemployment) and slack on the product market (idleness). It  addresses the following questions:

* Why does slack exist at the macroeconomic level?
* How and why does slack vary over time? 
* How are fluctuations in slack related to price and wage rigidities?
* What is the socially optimal level of slack?
* How should monetary policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
* How should fiscal policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
* What happens to slack at the zero lower bound?

The course is hosted at https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t5.html.

## Organization

This is a flipped course. Students watch lecture videos and go over readings at home. The lecture videos and readings are permanently available at https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t5.html. Class time is used for various activities:

* To discuss lecture and reading material
* To put lecture and reading material into practice through quizzes composed of several multiple-choice questions
* To develop a research paper on the topic of slack. 

## Material

The repository contains all the material for the course:

* `syllabus.md` - syllabus for the course
* `notes` folder - lectures notes, narrated in the [lecture videos](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t5.html)
