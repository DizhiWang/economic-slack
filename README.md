## Course webpage

## Course overview

The course covers research topics related to economic slack. This course is centered around formal modeling, but it also presents some of the evidence supporting the assumptions introduced in the models. The course addresses the following questions:

+ What is economic slack?
+ Why do we care about slack?
+ Why does slack exist?
+ How does slack affect economic life?
+ Why does slack vary over time? 
+ How are slack fluctuations related to price and wage rigidities?
+ What is the socially optimal level of slack?
+ How should monetary policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ How should fiscal policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ What happens to slack and policies at the zero lower bound?
+ Does the effectiveness of policies depend on the prevailing amount of slack?
