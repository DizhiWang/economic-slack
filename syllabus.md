### Course description

ECON2800 covers research topics related to economic slack. This course is centered around formal modeling, but it also presents some of the evidence supporting the assumptions introduced in the models.

#### What is economic slack?

Economic slack describes the amount of productive resources in the economy that are unused. There are many different forms of slack:

+ People who cannot find a job and remain unemployed
+ Machines left idle in a factory
+ Employed workers left idle on the job
+ Hotel rooms, restaurants table, airplane seats that remain vacant
+ Durable goods that cannot be sold and depreciate
+ Perishable goods that cannot be sold and perish

#### Why should we care about economic slack?

Economic slack represents a waste of productive resources, and it therefore is something that should be limited. Moreover, in addition to its wastefulness, unemployment generates other, large costs to society. People who are unemployed suffer from significantly lower mental and physical health than other people with similar income. Even employed people in areas with high unemployment report lower well-being. Accordingly, good economic policy should stabilize economic slack at a desirable level and avoid periods of elevated slack.

#### What questions will this course address?

The course presents models of economic slack and discusses policies used to tackle slack. The course tries to answer several questions: 

+ Why does slack exist and why do we care about it?
+ Why does slack vary over time? And how are these fluctuations related to price and wage rigidity?
+ What is the socially optimal level of slack?
+ How should monetary policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ How should fiscal policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ What happens to slack and policies at the zero lower bound?
+ Does the effectiveness of policies depend on the prevailing amount of slack?

#### Switching to research mode

All of you should be shifting away from learning the results of other peoples' research into learning how to conduct your own research. A major reason for teaching this material is to positively influence your research. We will also devote a good part of this course to active research. We will practice:

+ How to select a research question
+ How to position your paper in the literature
+ How to develop and refine the answer to your research question

By the end of the course, you will have experienced all the stages of a research project and completed a short research paper.

### Communication

#### Office hours

Office hours will be conducted in-person. Office hours are first-come-first-served: there is no need to sign up. Feel free to come to office hours to discuss concepts covered in lecture and readings, discuss your research project, or talk about any other course-related matters.

#### GitHub discussion portal

In addition to office hours, we will communicate through the discussion portal on the course's GitHub repository: https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/economic-slack/discussions. The discussion portal is designed to get you help quickly and efficiently. So rather than emailing me or each other, I encourage you to post your questions and queries on GitHub, and to respond to the queries of your fellow students whenever you can.

### Classes

This is a flipped course. 

+ At home, you will watch lectures and read articles.
+ Classes time will have three parts:

    1. During the first part of the class, we will discuss the lecture material and readings. To lead the discussion, you will give short presentations that summarize the material from lecture, the required readings, and the supplemental readings. We will discuss anything that is unclear and answer all questions. 
    2. During the second part, we will put the material from lecture and readings into practice. To do so, we will solve a number of multiple-choice questions.
    3. During the third part of class, you will work on your research project. This will involve both development of the project and presentation of various intermediate steps.

### Lectures and readings

At home, before each weekly meeting, you will have to watch [lecture videos](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t5.html) and go over [required readings](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t5.html).
  
+ Before Wednesday 14 September: videos & readings in section "Evolution of Business-Cycle Models"
+ Before Wednesday 21 September: videos & readings in section "Matching Function"
+ Before Wednesday 28 September: videos & readings in section "Price and Wage Rigidities"
+ Before Wednesday 5 October: videos & readings in section "Static Model of Slack"
+ Before Wednesday 12 October: videos & readings in section "Dynamic Model of Slack"
+ Before Wednesday 19 October: videos & readings in section "Model of Idleness and Unemployment"
+ Before Wednesday 26 October: videos & readings in section "Efficiency and Inefficiency"
+ Before Wednesday 2 November: videos & readings in section "Business Cycles"
+ Before Wednesday 9 November: videos & readings in section "Monetary Policy"
+ Before Wednesday 16 November: videos & readings in section "Fiscal Policy"
+ Before Wednesday 30 November: videos & readings in section "Policy Multipliers"

The required readings cover important material on which the lectures are based. You should read them from beginning to end, reproduce the key steps of the derivations, and remember the key results. 

[Supplemental readings](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t5.html) are also be provided in each section. These readings provide additional theoretical results, empirical evidence, some background, and may provide inspiration for your research. If you plan to do research in macroeconomics, you are encouraged to go over all the supplemental readings as well.

---

### Summary of the lectures and readings

At the beginning of class, we will discuss the lecture material and readings. To lead the discussion, everyone will give a short presentation that summarizes either the material from lecture or one of the readings.

Each presentation should have five slides with the following structure:

1. What is the research question addressed by the lecture/paper?
2. How does the material covered in the lecture/paper contribute to the previous literature? Which hole does it fill?
3. What are the main elements of the answer to the research question?
4. Illustrate graphically the answer to the research question.
5. What are the limitations of the answer provided in the lecture/paper? How could the answer be improved?

---

### Quizzes

Quizzes will contain mostly theoretical problems based on material covered in lectures and readings. They may also contain coding problems, or questions about the literature and empirical evidence. We will solve the quizzes in class.

---

### Research paper

#### Objective of the paper

One of the main objectives of the course is to produce a short research paper on topics related to macroeconomic slack. A good research paper should do the following:

+ Develop a well-posed research question
+ Answer the research question using a combination of theory, simulations, and empirical analysis
+ Position the paper in the prior literature

#### Key dates for the development of the paper

+ Wednesday 26 October: class presentation of the project outline
+ Wednesday 16 November: class presentation of early results
+ Wednesday 7 December: class presentation of final results
+ Wednesday 14 December: final paper due

#### Format of the paper

Your research paper should be short and follow the *AER: Insights* guidelines:

+ Manuscripts must be less than 6,000 words, with a maximum of five exhibits (figures or tables). The wordcount applies to the main body of the text, but excludes title page, reference list, and exhibits.
+ Manuscripts should contain no more than 5 exhibits (tables and figures). Individual exhibits are limited to one page each.
+ Manuscripts must include an abstract of 100 or fewer words.
+ Papers must be self-contained. Specifically, a reader should be able follow the analysis in the paper and be convinced it is correct and coherent from the main text alone, without consulting the appendix. For empirical work, the main text should include relevant information about data sources, variable definitions and construction, the estimating equations, and any other information needed to understand and assess each exhibit in the main text. For theoretical work, proofs should typically be contained in the paper. This is the case when the proof itself provides insight into the paper's argument or when the method of proof is innovative.
+ Manuscripts must be written in LaTeX, compiled to a PDF, and submitted by email to pascalmichaillat@brown.edu.
