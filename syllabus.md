### Course description

ECON2800 covers research topics related to economic slack, both on the labor market (unemployment) and on the product market (idleness). This course is centered around formal modeling, but it also presents some of the evidence supporting the assumptions introduced in the models. The course presents models used to describe economic slack and discusses policies used to tackle slack. It tries to answer several questions: 

+ Why does slack exist and why do we care about it?
+ Why does slack vary over time? And how is this related to price flexibility or rigidity?
+ What is the socially optimal level of slack?
+ How should monetary policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ How should fiscal policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ What happens to slack and policies at the zero lower bound?
+ Does the effectiveness of policies depend on the prevailing amount of slack?

All of you should be shifting away from learning the results of other peoples' research into learning how to conduct your own research. A major reason for teaching this material is to positively influence your research. We will also devote a good part of this course to active research. We will practice:

+ How to select of a research question
+ How to position a paper in the literature
+ How to develop an answer to a research question
+ How to refine and extend the answer to a research question

By the end of the course, you will have experienced all the stages of a research project and completed a short research paper.

+ The course material (syllabus, quizzes, research resources) is available at https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/economic-slack.

### Communication

#### Office hours

Office hours will be conducted in-person. Office hours are first-come-first-served: there is no need to sign up. Feel free to come to office hours to discuss concepts covered in lecture and readings, discuss your research project, or talk about any other course-related matters.

#### Github discussion portal

In addition to office hours, we will communicate through the discussion portal on the course's Github repository: https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/economic-slack/discussions. The discussion portal is designed to get you help quickly and efficiently. So rather than emailing me or each other, I encourage you to post your questions and queries on the portal, and to respond to the queries of your fellow students whenever you can.

### Classes

This is a flipped course. You will watch lectures and read articles at home, and we will discuss the material in class and put it to practice.  Classes will have two parts:

+ During the first part of the class, we will go over the lecture material and readings. We will discuss anything that is unclear and answer all questions. To put the material from lecture into practice, we will solve multiple-choice questions. 
+ During the second part of class, you will work on a research project. The second part will involve both development of the project and presentation of various intermediate steps.

### Lectures and readings

Before each weekly meeting you will have to watch [lecture videos](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t5.html) and go over [required readings](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t5.html).
  
+ Before Wednesday 14 September: videos & readings in section "Evolution of Business-Cycle Models"
+ Before Wednesday 21 September: videos & readings in section "Matching Function"
+ Before Wednesday 28 September: videos & readings in section "Price and Wage Rigidities"
+ Before Wednesday 5 October: videos & readings in section "Static Model of Slack"
+ Before Wednesday 12 October: videos & readings in section "Dynamic Model of Slack"
+ Before Wednesday 19 October: videos & readings in section "Model of Idleness and Unemployment"
+ Before Wednesday 26 October: videos & readings in section "Efficiency and Inefficiency"
+ Before Wednesday 2 November: videos & readings in section "Business Cycles"
+ Before Wednesday 9 November: videos & readings in section "Monetary Policy"
+ Before Wednesday 16 November: videos & readings in section "Fiscal Policy"
+ Before Wednesday 30 November: videos & readings in section "Policy Multipliers"

The required readings cover important material on which the lectures are based. You should read them from beginning to end, reproduce the key steps of the derivations, and remember the key results. 

[Supplemental readings](https://www.pascalmichaillat.org/t5.html) are also be provided in each section. These readings provide additional theoretical results, empirical evidence, some background, and may provide inspiration for your research. If you plan to do research in macroeconomics, you are encouraged to go over these supplemental readings as well.

### Research paper

#### Objective of the paper

One of the main objectives of the course is to produce a short research paper on topics related to macroeconomic slack. A good research paper should do the following:

+ Develop a well-posed research question
+ Answer the research question using a combination of theory, simulations, and empirical analysis
+ Position the paper in the prior literature

#### Key dates for the development of the paper

+ Wednesday 26 October: class presentation of the project outline
+ Wednesday 16 November: class presentation of early results
+ Wednesday 7 December: class presentation of final results
+ Wednesday 14 December: final paper due

#### Format of the paper

Your research paper should be short and follow the *AER: Insights* guidelines:

+ Manuscripts must be less than 6,000 words, with a maximum of five exhibits (figures or tables). The wordcount applies to the main body of the text, but excludes title page, reference list, and exhibits.
+ Manuscripts should contain no more than 5 exhibits (tables and figures). Individual exhibits are limited to one page each.
+ Manuscripts must include an abstract of 100 or fewer words.
+ Papers must be self-contained. Specifically, a reader should be able follow the analysis in the paper and be convinced it is correct and coherent from the main text alone, without consulting the appendix. For empirical work, the main text should include relevant information about data sources, variable definitions and construction, the estimating equations, and any other information needed to understand and assess each exhibit in the main text. For theoretical work, proofs should typically be contained in the paper. This is the case when the proof itself provides insight into the paper's argument or when the method of proof is innovative.
+ Manuscripts must be written in LaTeX, compiled to a PDF, and submitted by email to pascalmichaillat@brown.edu.

### Grading

Your grade will be based on the quality of the research project and your participation. The contribution to the total grade of 100 points is as follows:

+ Participation: 20 points. This is a research-intensive course. As such, attendance and participation are key. This portion of your grade will be based on your participation in class, response to the quizzes, participation to the [Github discussion portal](https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/economic-slack/discussions), and general community building.
+ Research project: 80 points. The project will be evaluated based on quality of analysis, clarity, and originality. The project grade will have the following components:

    - Presentation of project outline: 10 points
    - Presentation of early results: 10 points
    - Presentation of final results: 10 points
    - Final paper: 50 points

Letter grades will be based on your total grade, with the following cutoffs:

+ Above 80/100:  A
+ Between 60/100 and 80/100: B
+ Between 40/100 and 60/100: C
+ Below 40/100: NC
