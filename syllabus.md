## Course description

The course covers research topics related to economic slack. The course is centered around formal modeling, but it also presents some of the evidence supporting the assumptions introduced in the models.

### What is economic slack?

Economic slack describes the amount of productive resources in the economy that are unused. There are many different forms of slack:

+ People who cannot find a job and remain unemployed
+ Machines left idle in a factory
+ Employed workers left idle on the job
+ Hotel rooms, restaurants table, airplane seats that remain vacant
+ Durable goods that cannot be sold and depreciate
+ Perishable goods that cannot be sold and perish

### Why should we care about economic slack?

Economic slack represents a waste of productive resources, and it therefore is something that should be limited. Moreover, in addition to its wastefulness, unemployment generates other, large costs to society. People who are unemployed suffer from significantly lower mental and physical health than other people with similar income. Even employed people in areas with high unemployment report lower well-being. Accordingly, good economic policy should stabilize economic slack at a desirable level and avoid periods of elevated slack.

### What questions will this course address?

The course presents models of economic slack and discusses policies used to tackle slack. The course tries to answer several questions: 

+ Why does slack exist
+ How does slack affect economic life?
+ Why does slack vary over time? 
+ How are slack fluctuations related to price and wage rigidity?
+ What is the socially optimal level of slack?
+ How should monetary policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ How should fiscal policy respond to fluctuations in slack over the business cycle?
+ What happens to slack and policies at the zero lower bound?
+ Does the effectiveness of policies depend on the prevailing amount of slack?

### Switching to research mode

All of you should be shifting away from learning the results of other peoples' research into learning how to conduct your own research. A major reason for teaching this material is to positively influence your research. We will also devote a good part of this course to active research. We will practice:

+ How to select a research question
+ How to position your paper in the literature
+ How to develop and refine the answer to your research question

By the end of the course, you will have experienced all the stages of a research project and completed a short research paper.

## Communication

### Office hours

Office hours will be conducted in-person. Office hours are first-come-first-served: there is no need to sign up. Feel free to come to office hours to discuss concepts covered in lecture and readings, discuss your research project, or talk about any other course-related matters.

### GitHub Discussions

In addition to office hours, we will communicate using [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/economic-slack/discussions). This collaborative discussion forum is designed to get you help quickly and efficiently. You can ask and answer questions, share updates, have open-ended conversations, and follow along on decisions affecting the course. So rather than emailing me or each other, I encourage you to post your questions and queries on GitHub, and to participate whenever you can.

## Classes

This is a flipped course. 

+ At home, you will watch lectures and read articles.
+ Classes time will have three parts:

    1. During the first part of the class, we will discuss the lecture material and readings. To lead the discussion, you will give short presentations that summarize the material from the required readings and supplemental readings. We will discuss anything that is unclear and answer all questions. 
    2. During the second part, we will discuss the material from lecture and readings.
    3. During the third part of class, you will work on your research project. This will involve both development of the project and presentation of various intermediate steps.

## Tentative Schedule of Lectures & readings

At home, before each weekly meeting, you will have to watch [lecture videos](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/) and go over [readings](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/).
  
+ Before Wednesday 14 September: videos & readings in ["Overview of business-cycle models"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#overview-of-business-cycle-models)
+ Before Wednesday 21 September: videos & readings in ["Prevalence of slack and matching function"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#prevalence-of-slack-and-matching-function)
+ Before Wednesday 28 September: videos 20–27 & readings in ["Basic model of slack"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#basic-model-of-slack)
+ Before Wednesday 5 October: videos 28–40 in ["Basic model of slack"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#basic-model-of-slack)
+ Before Wednesday 12 October: videos & readings in ["Model of slack with income and wealth inequality"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#model-of-slack-with-income-and-wealth-inequality)
+ Before Wednesday 19 October: videos & readings in ["Discussion of the solution concept"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#discussion-of-the-solution-concept)
+ Before Wednesday 26 October: videos & readings in ["Price and wage rigidities"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#price-and-wage-rigidities)
+ Before Wednesday 2 November: videos & readings in ["Model of slack with labor and product markets"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#model-of-slack-with-labor-and-product-markets)
+ Before Wednesday 9 November: videos & readings in  ["Dynamic model of slack"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#dynamic-model-of-slack)
+ Before Wednesday 16 November: videos & readings in ["Social welfare, efficiency, and inefficiency"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#social-welfare-efficiency-and-inefficiency)
+ Before Wednesday 30 November: videos & readings in ["Optimal monetary policy over the business cycle"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#optimal-monetary-policy-over-the-business-cycle)
+ Before Wednesday 7 December: videos & readings in ["Optimal government spending over the business cycle"](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/#optimal-government-spending-over-the-business-cycle)

The required readings cover important material on which the lectures are based. You should read them from beginning to end, reproduce the key steps of the derivations, and remember the key results. [Supplemental readings](https://pascalmichaillat.org/c2/) are also be provided in each section. These readings provide additional theoretical results, empirical evidence, some background, and may provide inspiration for your research. If you plan to do research in macroeconomics, you are encouraged to go over all the supplemental readings as well.

This is a tentative schedule. Updates to the schedule will be communicated via the [discussion forum](https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/economic-slack/discussions).

## Summary of lectures & readings

At the beginning of class, we will discuss the lecture material and readings. To lead the discussion, everyone will give a short presentation that summarizes one of the readings.

Each presentation should have at the minimum five slides addressing the following questions:

1. What is the research question addressed by the paper?
2. How does the material covered in the paper contribute to the previous literature? Which hole does it fill?
3. What are the main elements of the answer to the research question?
4. Illustrate graphically the answer to the research question or an interesting mechanism discussed in the paper.
5. What are the limitations of the answer provided in the paper? How could the answer be improved?

If you need a few more slides to explain the paper and its results, or if you need not just one but a few graphs to explain the mechanisms, that is no problem at all as long as the presentation remain below 20 minutes.

## Research paper

One of the main objectives of the course is to produce a short research paper on a topic related to economic slack.

### Objective of the paper

A good research paper should do the following:

+ Develop a well-posed research question
+ Answer the research question using a combination of theory, simulations, and empirical analysis
+ Position the paper in the prior literature

### Tentative due dates

+ Wednesday 26 October: class presentation of the project outline
+ Wednesday 16 November: class presentation of early results
+ Wednesday 7 December: class presentation of final results
+ Wednesday 14 December: final paper due

This is a tentative schedule for the paper's due dates. Updates to the schedule will be communicated via the [discussions forum](https://github.com/pascalmichaillat/economic-slack/discussions).

### Format

Your research paper should be short and follow the *AER: Insights* guidelines:

+ Manuscripts must be less than 6,000 words, with a maximum of five exhibits (figures or tables). The wordcount applies to the main body of the text, but excludes title page, reference list, and exhibits.
+ Manuscripts should contain no more than 5 exhibits (tables and figures). Individual exhibits are limited to one page each.
+ Manuscripts must include an abstract of 100 or fewer words.
+ Papers must be self-contained. Specifically, a reader should be able follow the analysis in the paper and be convinced it is correct and coherent from the main text alone, without consulting the appendix. For empirical work, the main text should include relevant information about data sources, variable definitions and construction, the estimating equations, and any other information needed to understand and assess each exhibit in the main text. For theoretical work, proofs should typically be contained in the paper. This is the case when the proof itself provides insight into the paper's argument or when the method of proof is innovative.
+ Manuscripts must be written in LaTeX, compiled to a PDF, and [submitted by email](mailto:pascalmichaillat@brown.edu).

## Grading

Your grade will be based on the quality of the research project and your participation. The contribution to the total grade of 100 points is as follows:

+ Participation: 30 points. This is a research-intensive course. As such, attendance and participation are key. The participation grade will be based on various elements:
    
    - Summary of the lecture and reading material in class
